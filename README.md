# Personal Finance Tracker

## About This Project

This is my **personal project**, originally created to serve as part of my **portfolio**. The goal is to showcase my skills in full-stack development, DevOps practices, and modern web application architecture.  

The project is designed as a **highly flexible and automated web application** for tracking personal finances, income, and expenses. It is aimed at **individuals, small projects, freelancers, and small businesses**, but can be adapted for other use cases.  

By building this project, I aim to:

- Apply and demonstrate **DevOps principles**: CI/CD, containerization (Docker), environment management, and automated deployments.
- Implement **modern web development patterns** using **Django** (backend) and **React with Redux** (frontend).  
- Create a **scalable, modular, and maintainable codebase** that can evolve over time.  
- Showcase the full lifecycle of a software project: planning, version control, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

## Project Goals

1. **Portfolio Showcase**: Demonstrate my skills for potential employers or collaborators.  
2. **Learning & Experimentation**: Experiment with new technologies, patterns, and best practices.  
3. **Flexibility**: Enable the application to grow into either:
   - A **full open-source project**, or  
   - A **private/commercial project** in the future.  
4. **Financial Tracking**: Provide a practical tool for users to monitor income and expenses effectively.
